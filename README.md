## Articles Headlines App

**Note from Sweny Bagrecha - Android Developer**

- Made use of Clean Architecture structure
- Design Architecture Used: MVVM
- Implemented tab bar main navigation containing 3 tabs: **Headlines, Sources, Saved.**
- The clean Architecture includes: **Repository, Usecase, Domain, Fragments(UI), Adapters, ViewModels**
- Reusuable functions are included in **Utils**
- Used Safe args to send data as part of navigation between two fragments
- Made use of **BaseActivity, BaseViewModel, BaseFragment** for handling few things such as **ProgressBase, APIerrors**
- Null checks have been taken inconsideration
- I have put Method level comments as well.
- Due to short of time, given that only a day was provided in-order to build the whole app. There
    are few things that are pending which includes **Save icon on Heading screen, selected items o Heading screen**
- For pending items, I have added TODOs
- Please go throught the whole project, run the app, you would be happy to see :)
